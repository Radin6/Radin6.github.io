        <Article title="Past">
          I have always liked exact sciences, that's why I became a Chemistry
          Technician and then, a Food Industry Technician. Although I like them,
          I felt there was not so much to innovate in this area, so I decided to
          transition to Web Development, as it is governed by rules like the
          exact sciences. This field/industry is open to innovation and
          creativity. Above all, it is a changing world and there is so much to
          discover.

        <Article title="Present">
          I am currently working on a project called Servi, which is a
          marketplace for freelance jobs. At the same time, I am studying Full
          Stack Development specializing in blockchain. Iâ€™m also working on a
          course. I teach individual and group lessons about blockchain
          technology and how to interact with it.

        <Article title="Future">
          In the future, I find myself specializing in branches of development
          that interest me since I enjoy continuous learning. Especially, I see
          myself bringing that knowledge into projects I am part of.
